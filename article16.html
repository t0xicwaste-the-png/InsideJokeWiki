            <h1>LITTLE JOHN</h1>
            <p>Ill let the CIIO take care of this one

                Someone killed Little Johnny, then he was buried. Then, someone dug up Little Johns grave.
                
                Liam Edmonds and Allan killed little john. Were not completely sure what happened, but we do know that they got a hold of him by stealing him from Mr. Buttle. It is likely that Liam Edmonds did less kill as he was little Johnny's creator
                
                We're not sure who dug up little johnny. James and Liam Edmonds both admitted to doing it, but Liam Edmonds later said he said he did it to defend Allan (who was a suspect during the original court case)
                
                Little John is brought to school, and he is broken and beaten by Allan and Liam later, he is buried the next day, and his grave has been robbed, or so it seems a court case is started Liam is the main suspect, but so areAllan James and Marcus the grave site is excavated more and little johns torso and legs were recovered his head was never recovered little john returns the next day in a new body which is also destroyed the person who did the crime is still unknown he was meant to be buried but a war ensues for his parts, in the end, Liam gets the arms and legs, William receives the head.
                
                Three days after the previous events, Liam reveals that little John has had a cult ever since the witch trials (which he caused along with 911 and many others). He had joined that cult, and Little John had tasked him with creating new bodies for him, and he had stopped making them, so Little John was going to take his brain over after saying all this, Liam claims that everything he just said was fake and hes himself, but the others did not believe him until he starts saying things only he would know he then goes to the front where Adam is he reveals that he is little john and that Adam used to be his godly brother before he consumes his power Adam says “lets stop roleplaying now” “Liam” agrees.
                
                Almost 4 weeks later, Liam seems to stop moving and becomes unresponsive he wakes up and almost instantly asks, “How long has it been?” his friends are confused what does he mean he says since little John took over, they realize it hasn’t been Liam for almost a month it was little john Liam is a little mad that they never realized it wasnt him but what hes more worried about is the fact that hes been gone for just less than a month but suddenly his memories come flooding back hes confused why little john gave them back he informs his friends about everything we just covered it is unknown why little john did this or where he is</p>
